# Price-Searcher
Takes a list of items (at the moment, alcohol) and scrapes websites to see if they're on sale for cheaper than I'd like to pay.
When adding an item, I create a little dictionary with the shops they're available in, and the prefered price I'd like to pay. 
Then, if there's an item for cheaper, it lets me know!
